This is distributed as code only and not a Visual Studio project due to the number of versions of Visual Studio that exist.

To setup a Visual Studio project with this code:

1. Create a new console project, name it anything you want
2. Copy this whole folder into the source folder of the project you just created
3. In the solution explorer, select the project's source folder where you just copied the files
4. In the solution explorer's top button bar, click "Show All Files"
5. The folder with the example code that you just copied should now be visible
6. Right click on the folder and select "Include in Project"
7. The examples will now be added to your project.
8. To run an example, just call it from "Main()"
